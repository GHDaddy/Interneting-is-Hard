    <h1>Interneting is Easy Actually!</h1>
    <p>First we gotta learn some nice HTML</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of a site. There's six freaking levels to this stuff!</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you unordered list</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element(it means unordered list if you didn't know)</li>
      <li>Add each item in it's own list element</li>
      <li>They don't need an order (woo!)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

      <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>

    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to scream!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
    <p>Regards,<br>
